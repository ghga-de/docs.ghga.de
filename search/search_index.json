Non-personal Metadata Information that describes or annotates research data to facilitate its interpretation or to describe the relationship between data elements. For example, the name of the instrument used to generate the data or information defining a group of data subjects. Non-personal metadata will be available for public search online within the GHGA Data Infrastructure. Omics Data The Research Data collected as part of omics-based research. This research focuses on collecting information regarding the entire set of certain molecules in a sample. Within the context of GHGA, Omics Data linked to genetic information of an individual are of particular interest since in many cases omics data would fall under the definition of personal data in Art. 4 Nr. 1 GDPR. Types of Omics Data considered in GHGA are e.g.: genomics \u2013 the entirety of the hereditary information in a sample\u2019s DNA; transcriptomics \u2013 the entirety of the RNA transcribed from DNA; epigenomics \u2013 information on epigenetic modifications of the genetic materials.

For details see here. Personal Metadata Information that describes or annotates research data to facilitate its interpretation or to describe the relationship between data elements. For example, demographic data or information on the ancestry of the data subjects of the research data that allow conclusions to be drawn about individuals and thus fall within the scope of the GDPR, Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR. Personal metadata are made available to the data requester together with the research data only under controlled access after release by the data submitter. Research Data Controller (RDC) Institution that is the controller (as defined by the GDPR) of Research Data and that contracted GHGA for processing the Research Data on their behalf.

The Archive function of GHGA is envisioned to handle a wide variety of omics and research data. The GHGA metadata model aims at facilitating  comprehensive submissions that maximize the amount of collected metadata without creating friction on the submitter side, enabling (reusable) submissions of different types of -omics data into GHGA. This metadata model can satisfy the heterogeneous needs of submitters while maintaining the FAIR principles, interoperability with EGA and facilitating streamlined user journeys.</p> <p>Classes in the schema can be grouped into Research Metadata and Administrative Metadata based on the information they capture. The Research Metadata aims at maximising the reusability and FAIRness of the data, while the Administrative Metadata focuses on managing the resources, such as creation or acquisition of the data, rights management, and disposition. The Research Metadata classes include Individual, Biospcimen/Sample, Experiment, Experiment Method, Analysis and Analysis Method.

For example, instead of using free text \u2018heart tissue\u2019 to represent the site from which a Biospecimen was derived from, we would recommend using the appropriate concept BTO:0004293 heart endothelium.</p>"},{"location":"metadata/standards/#data-use-ontology","title":"Data Use Ontology","text":"<p>Endorsed by GA4GH, the Data Use Ontology (DUO) allows users to tag datasets with usage restrictions, allowing them to become automatically discoverable based on a health, clinical, or biomedical researcher\u2019s authorization level or intended use. We recommend the use of concepts from DUO to represent the use restrictions associated with a Dataset. For example, instead of having use restrictions as free text in a Data Access Policy, we would recommend using the appropriate concepts from DUO to better represent the granularity of use conditions and restrictions.</p>"},{"location":"metadata/standards/#human-ancestry-ontology","title":"Human Ancestry Ontology","text":"<p>The Human Ancestry Ontology (HANCESTRO) provides a systematic description of the ancestry concepts. HANCESTRO was originally built for NHGRI-GWAS Catalog and has since then been used by other consortia like the GA4GH, and the Human Cell Atlas. We recommend the use of concepts from HANCESTRO to represent the ancestry of an Individual. For example, instead of using \u2018European ancestry\u2019 to represent the ancestry of an Individual, we would recommend using the appropriate concept HANCESTRO:0005 European.</p>"},{"location":"metadata/standards/#human-phenotype-ontology","title":"Human Phenotype Ontology","text":"<p>The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease. HPO is used by various consortia like the GA4GH, Solve-RD, and IRDiRC. We recommend the use of concepts from HPO to represent phenotypic abnormalities that characterize a Biospecimen and/or an Individual. For example, instead of using free text \u2018Heart attack\u2019 to represent an Individual who has suffered from a heart attack, we would recommend using the appropriate concept HP:0001658 Myocardial infarction.</p>"},{"location":"metadata/standards/#international-classification-of-diseases","title":"International Classification of Diseases","text":"<p>The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is widely used across the world and is a crucial source of information on the prevalence, causes, and outcomes of human disease and mortality. Through the use of standardized coding, clinical information can be collected and recorded using ICD in primary, secondary, and tertiary care settings, as well as on death certificates. These data form the foundation for disease surveillance and statistical analysis, which inform healthcare planning, payment systems, quality control, and research. In addition, ICD's diagnostic categories facilitate consistent data collection and enable large-scale research studies. We recommend the use of classifications from ICD to represent a diagnosis associated with an Individual. For example, instead of using free text \u2018Malignant neoplasm of thymus\u2019 to represent that an Individual suffers from thymic carcinoma, we would recommend using the appropriate concept C37 Malignant neoplasm of thymus.</p>"},{"location":"metadata/standards/#mondo-disease-ontology","title":"Mondo Disease Ontology","text":"<p>The Mondo Disease Ontology (Mondo) provides a unified disease terminology that yields precise equivalences between disease concepts across various terminologies like OMIM, Orphanet, EFO, and DOID.

We recommend the use of concepts from Mondo to represent diseases associated with a Biospecimen and/or an Individual. For example, instead of using free text \u2018Myocardial infarction\u2019 to represent an Individual who has suffered from a heart attack, we would recommend using the appropriate concept MONDO:0005068 Myocardial infarction.</p>"},{"location":"metadata/standards/#national-cancer-institute-thesaurus","title":"National Cancer Institute Thesaurus","text":"<p>The National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIt) is a reference terminology covering the cancer domain, including diseases, abnormalities, anatomy, drugs, genes, and more.

We recommend the use of concepts from NCIt to represent the case or control status associated with a Sample. For example, instead of using free text \u2018True Case Status\u2019 to represent the case status of a sample, we would recommend using the appropriate concept NCIT:C99269 True Case Status.</p>"},{"location":"metadata/data_dictionary/00_overview/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The GHGA Data Dictionary provides precise definitions of terms used in the metadata schema.

It is crucial, that only non-personal metadata are submitted to GHGA.</p> <p>Identifiers and quasi-identifiers in the metadata model</p> <p>Identifiers are data elements that are unique to an entity, and can be used to directly identify that entity. For example, a person's name can directly identify them. Within the GHGA metadata model, sample IDs are unique to a Data Subject, and Data Submitters are advised to ensure that any matching file that contains both the sample ID and personal data about the Data Subject is securely held. Quasi-identifiers, by contrast, are attributes that may not identify an individual on their own but could lead to re-identification when used in combination. In the GHGA metadata model, we consider sex, age, diagnosis, phenotypic feature, ancestry, and geographic region to be quasi-identifiers. While the model employs privacy by design, Data Submitters should be aware that rare combinations of quasi-identifiers could lead to re-identification of the Data Subject.
