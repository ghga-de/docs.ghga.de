# Data Access Request

The GHGA Data Portal enables users to request access to data through the portal. Browse for your dataset of interest and then click on the "Request Access" button. This will direct you to a data access request form. Complete the form with the necessary information and submit it to request access to the dataset. The data access committee will review your request and respond accordingly.

For further details on how to access data, please refer to the [Data Download](./data_download.md) documentation.
