Types of Omics Data considered in GHGA are e.g.: genomics โ the entirety of the hereditary information in a sampleโs DNA; transcriptomics โ the entirety of the RNA transcribed from DNA; epigenomics โ information on epigenetic modifications of the genetic materials.

general:Personal Metadata 
:   Information that describes or annotates research data to facilitate its interpretation or to describe the relationship between data elements. For example, demographic data or information on the ancestry of the data subjects of the research data that allow conclusions to be drawn about individuals and thus fall within the scope of the GDPR, Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR. Personal metadata are made available to the data requester together with the research data only under controlled access after release by the data submitter.

general:Research Data Controller (RDC)
:   Institution that is the controller (as defined by the GDPR) of Research Data and that contracted GHGA for processing the Research Data on their behalf. The term is also used for the corresponding party if the processing of the Research Data is only intended, i.e. before such a contract is established.
