## What are the functions of the GHGA Data Portal?

The GHGA Data Portal allows users to browse, search, and download omics datasets submitted to the GHGA. It uses the [GHGA Metadata Model](metadata/overview.md).

## What data can be found on GHGA Data Portal?

Please visit the [GHGA Data Portal browse page](https://data.ghga.de/browse) and find your data of interest either by a keyword search or by using the selectors on the left side. Currently, we are only displaying datasets from GHGA partner institutions.

## How to upload your data to the GHGA Data Portal?

Currently GHGA is still in an early phase of the project and is therefore in general only accepting data submissions from partner institutions. If you would like to submit human omics data to GHGA, please contact the [GHGA Helpdesk](mailto:contact@ghga.de).

## How to get data access?

The GHGA Data Portal allows users to request access to data through the portal. Identify your dataset of interest using the browse and filter functions of the GHGA Data Portal.

The data access request will be sent to the <general:Research Data Controller (RDC)|Research Data Controller>, who will will review your request and respond accordingly.
