# Citing GHGA Submissions

To reference a study included in the GHGA Archive in publications or other media, please always reference the study accession, e.g. `GHGAS12079965883832`. This accession number serves as umbrella for all datasets included in the related [study](../../metadata/entities.md#study).


## Data Availability Statement

 We recommend using the following statement to reference the data deposition in journals:

!!! note "Data Availability Statement"

      The data generated in this study are available via controlled access in the German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA, [data.ghga.de](https://data.ghga.de)) under the GHGA Accession https://data.ghga.de/study/GHGAS12079965883832. Further details, including the data access policy for the study, can be found there.

This statement contains a stable URL to the study. This link and the study will be maintained and can both be cited.

## Federated EGA and GHGA as an Approved Data Repository

The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) is the main repository approved by several journals for the deposition of human omics data. In order to better address some of the data protection and legal challenges that researchers have faced when depositing data there, the EGA has started to move to a federated model (FEGA), whereby national nodes will work with the central EGA to support the archival of omics data. GHGA is the national FEGA node for Germany as described here:  [Federated EGA - EGA European Genome-Phenome Archive](https://ega-archive.org/about/projects-and-funders/federated-ega/). 

In the future, metadata deposited in GHGA will be findeable in the EGA Data Portal. This functionality is currently being worked on.

GHGA can also be found on [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100014563) and [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/6353).

## Additional Journal Requirements

**Requirement:  Specific reasons for controlled access must be transparently described in your data statement.**

**A:** Please outline the reasoning in the Data Access Policy section of the non-personal metadata you have provided during your submission to GHGA and refer to it.


**Requirement: Data should be presented as a fully linkable URL**

**A:** Always reference the study via the relevant GHGA Study Accession: https://data.ghga.de/study/GHGAS12079965883832


**Requirement: Describe the timeframe associated with gaining access**

**A:** The Data Submitter is responsible for defining how Data Requesters can gain access to the data they have submitted. Some journals may require that your data availability statement clarifies how long this process is expected to take.


**Requirement: Describe the authorship requirements**

**A:** Some Data Submitters require Data Requesters who utilise data that they have archived to include the Data Submitter as a co-author in any publication based upon that data. When submitting data to GHGA, please check whether such a policy exists at your institution, so that it can be included in your data availability statement if needed.

**Requirement: The reviewers ask for Reviewer Access**

**A:** Same as at the EGA, download access to the files cannot be granted to persons without an approved Data Access Request. For studies that are already released on the GHGA Data Portal, the non-personal metadata can be downloaded as excel file as proof of upload via the GHGA Study Accession: https://data.ghga.de/api/rts/studies/GHGAS12079965883832
