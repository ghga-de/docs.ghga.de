## Federated EGA and GHGA as approved data repository

The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) is the main repository approved by several journals for the deposition of human omics data. In order to better address some of the data protection and legal challenges that researchers have faced when depositing data there, the EGA has started to move to a federated model (FEGA), whereby national nodes will work with the central EGA to support the archival of omics data. GHGA is the national FEGA node for Germany as described here:  [Federated EGA - EGA European Genome-Phenome Archive](https://ega-archive.org/about/projects-and-funders/federated-ega/). 

In the future, metadata deposited in GHGA will be findeable in the EGA Data Portal. This functionality is currently being worked on.
