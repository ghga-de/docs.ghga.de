# Preparation of a Data Processing Contract for submission to GHGA Archive

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Legal Prerequisites

 - [**GHGA Data Processing Contract**](https://www.ghga.de/Downloads/GHGA_Data_Processing_Contract.pdf): A Data Processing Contract is agreed between GHGA Central and institutions that submit data. It sets out how GHGA may process the data, and what the Data Submittersâ€™ responsibilities are. It has been designed to conform with Art. 28 GDPR.



## Specification of LS IDs for usage in contracts
