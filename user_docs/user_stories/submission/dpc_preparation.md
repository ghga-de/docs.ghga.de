# Preparation of a GHGA Data Processing Contract for submission to GHGA Archive

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Legal Prerequisites

 - [**GHGA Data Processing Contract**](https://www.ghga.de/Downloads/GHGA_Data_Processing_Contract.pdf)

## Introduction

A GHGA Data Processing Contract (DPC) is signed by GHGA Central and an institution this is the Data Controller for data that is to be submitted to GHGA. The DPC sets out how GHGA may process the data, the role of the GHGA Data Hubs, and what the Data Submitters’ responsibilities are. 

The DPC creates a controller to processor relationship between the institution and GHGA Central. It has been designed to conform with [Art. 28 GDPR Nr. 3](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/).

!!! note "Difference between Data Controller and Data Submitter"
   The GDPR defines a Data Controller as the party which "determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data". Within the context of GHGA, we also refer to the Data Submitter to mean the person or institution which is submitting data to GHGA. In many cases, the Data Controller and Data Submitter will be the same institution but not always, it is therefore important for the Data Submitter to check who is Data Controller for the data they wish to submit to GHGA.  

## The GHGA Data Processing Contract

The DPC can be considered to be in two parts. The first part, comprised of the *Premable* to *§7 - Signing* focuses on the services that GHGA offers to the Data Controller when they sign the DPC. 

*Premable* - This section introduces GHGA  and the objectives of the project.

*§1 - Definitions* - 

*§2 - Purpose of this Agreement* - 

*§3 - Right to Termination* - 

*§4 - Process for the Termination of the Agreement* -

*§5 - Warranties and Liabilities* -

*§6 - Final Provisions* -

*§7 - Signing* -

The second part of the DPC is annexes which focus on the data protection aspects for the different data types which are processed under the DPC.
