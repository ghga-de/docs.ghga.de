## Note on Submission Service

!!! info "Limitations on External Submissions"

    GHGA has only recently launched the functionality of the GHGA Data Portal. Our ongoing efforts concentrate on data upload processes and to improve the overall user experience. Since data upload currently includes manual steps by GHGA data stewards, data upload by external users is not yet possible. We are looking forward to launching a submitter portal that allows GHGA to accept data from external submitters and GHGA users to upload data themselves in a future release.
