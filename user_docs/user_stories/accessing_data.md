# Accessing Data
## Creating a Data Access Request
 - The GHGA Data Portal enables users to request access to data through the portal.
 - For creating a [data access request](../glossary/glossary.md#data-access-request-dar) you need to have a Life Science Login / LS ID. See [here](ls-login.md) for further information on this.
 - Browse for your dataset of interest and then click on the "Request Access" button. This will direct you to a data access request form. 
 - Complete the form with the necessary information and submit your [data access request](../glossary/glossary.md#data-access-request-dar). 
 - The data access request will be sent to the [research data controller](../glossary/glossary.md#research-data-controller-rdc), who will will review your request and respond accordingly. Please note that GHGA is not involved in the further process of negotiating the data access.

!!! note "Responsibilities for handling of data access requests"
    Please note the GHGA is not responsible for deciding of data access requests as this is a responsibility of [Data Access Committee](../glossary/glossary.md#data-access-committee-dac) installed by the the [research data controller](../glossary/glossary.md#research-data-controller-rdc). In case you do not receive notifications about the decision on your request, please first contact the DAC as indicated on the [dataset details page](../user_stories/browsing_data.md#dataset-details)
